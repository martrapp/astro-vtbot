# **The Bag of Tricks** for Astro's **View Transitions**

The bag of tricks provides extensions & support around Astro's view transitions.

## !!! NEW TRICKS ✨ IN THE BAG 👜 !!!

### More Starlight Improvements: ###

The selection of optional Starlight components keeps growing:

> Ever wished clicking on Starlight's _previous page_ and _next page_ links would slide content from the left respectively from the right?  Now you can enable `<PageOrder />` on Starlight sites. This automatically alters the _direction_ of the view transition. Visit a page further down the sidebar and get a _forward_ navigation, visit a page further up, and you get a _back_ navigation.

> Eliminate the Pseudo-Scrolling of the Main Section: With [`<PageOffset />`](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/library/PageOffset/), The Bag offers a simple to use component that eliminates pseudo scrolling effects induced by morph transitions on elements that are larger than the viewport. Especially useful to get a smooth and neat transition animation for your main content.

> Improved Sidebar Handling: When you navigate to a page that has its entry within a collapsed category, the category is now automatically turned open. If the current page marker is outside the visible
part of the sidebar, it is automatically scrolled into view. **New: Support for your own customizations!**

## Recently learned tricks ##

> If you want to use `transition:persist` inside the main content area, you can do that now! As of v1.7.8 the `<ReplacementSwap />` component handles `data-astro-transition-persist` attributes within the replaced DOM trees in the same way as Astro's built-in `swap()` function does.


> The [Jotter](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/) now leverages Starlight! The beginning of a more structured and searchable version of the pile of notes that it was.

> Starlight Support: Ever wanted to see what your Starlight site looks like with view transitions enabled? Follow [these steps](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/starlight/guide/) to get rid of full page loads and make your Starlight site look like a SPA!




## Reusable Components 🧩

- In need for extensions for view transitions because you have issues with iframes on your pages?
- Wanting support in understanding and debugging view transitions or simply want a second pair of eyes 👀 on your view transition settings?
- Looking for reusable animations or special transition effects?
- Want to use view transitions on your Starlight site?

The `astro-vtbot`package isn't a monolithic library. Use the components you need and only pay bandwidth for those.

Visit [the documentation](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/components/) of the reusable components for detailed information.

- `<Linter/>`: A linter component that helps you identify problems when setting up transitions.

- `<VtBotDebug/>`: A Debugging component that logs the events and their data as they occur.

- `<ReplacementSwap/>`: An alterantive DOM swap(), which preserves elements in the original DOM to avoid reinitialization of iframes or CSS animations.

- `<LoadIndicator>`: Have you ever missed the visual feedback on sites with view transitions as to whether the app has noticed the click? You need a loading indicator! Here you go!

- `Zoom`, `<Move>` and `Swing` animations and the `<AnimationsStyle/>` component allows for extended styling options.

- `<Portal/>` component that forces all view transitions through a portal/loading page.

- `<NoScroll/>` keep the current vertical and horizontal scroll position when transitioning to the next page.

## Tech Demos 🔥

The bag of tricks currently contains [several technical demos](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/demos/) that show examples of the implementation of various effects using the view transition events.

The sources are in [this repository](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot-website).

## The Jotter 📓

Last but not least, the deployment also includes the [▶ Jotter ◀](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/) with a wealth of information on transition events as well as background information and valuable tips & tricks on view transitions in Astro.

Some of the contents are technical demos, some are useful tools, and some are reusable components that you can use in your own project to handle edge cases that go beyond Astro's standard features.
