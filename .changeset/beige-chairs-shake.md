Introducing a new tool for your transition from `<ViewTransitions />` to `@view-transitions {navigation: auto}`: The `<TurnSignal />` component enables seamless integration of forward and backward animations from `transition:animate` in cross-document transitions. Sync the direction of your animations with browser history navigation, or even with the page order of your site, if you prefer!
